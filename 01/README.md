## Week 1 - Setup

This week is all about getting the environments set up: Slack, Reclaim Hosting (or another hosting account if you have one), Visual Studio Code, and GitHub. If you run into any problems just ask for help in Slack.

**Assignment**

All parts of the assignment are discussed in the intro video above.

Part 1: Say "hi" in Slack by writing a blurb about yourself in the General channel.

Part 2: Create or re-familiarize yourself with your Reclaim Hosting account <https://reclaimhosting.com> (or another hosting account if you have one).

Part 3: Install or re-famimliarize yourself with Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>, the editor we will be using for text and code files.

Part 4: Create or re-familiarize yourself with your GitHub account <https://github.com>. Then, 
- Fork the class repository which is located at: <https://github.com/craigdietrich/DIG540>;
- In GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com>, clone your fork onto your local computer;
- In Visual Studio Code, edit the vocabulary.txt file like I did in the video;
- Back in GitHub Desktop, commit your changes to GitHub;
- In the GitHub website for your repository, create a pull request so I can see your new vocabulary term and merge it to the main branch.

**The assignment should be done by Wednesday Sept. 7th.**
